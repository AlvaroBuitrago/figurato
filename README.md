# figurato
A figured bass font for Dorico  
(Tested only on Windows)

Use the font in text objects or with the lyrics popover.  
n = natural  
b = flat  
\# = sharp  
bb = double flat  
x = double sharp  
/ = combining slash

Figures are automatically stacked from bottom to top. Currently only accidentals to the right of the numbers are supported.  
If you need a single accidental in the bottommost stack, separate it with "." (period): "b.5"  
If you need to skip a stack, type "," (comma): "#.,7n"  
If you need a slashed figure, type "/" (slash) after the figure: "6/"
