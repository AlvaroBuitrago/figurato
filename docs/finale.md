## Figurato

### How to use Figurato in Finale

There are basically two ways to create figured bass indications with Figurato in Finale.

#### Lyrics

1. On the Fonts page of the Document Options dialog set one of the lyric fonts to Figurato. (Finale’s font selection can be a real pain. Be sure to input just ‘Figurato’, even if the list wants you to choose ‘Figurato Standard’.)  
2. Switch to the lyrics tool and select the lyric type you just configured for Figurato via the menu.
3. Type the figures directly into your score. Don’t despair if the figures look terrible while you’re typing – Finale’s rendering engine was state-of-the-art in the nineties. It will eventually sort everything out.
4. You’ll need to remove unwanted extender lines one by one and reposition a few figures manually.

#### Text expressions

If you only need a few standard figures you can also define a new category for text expressions and create a single expression for every figure. (Same here, make sure you set the font to ‘Figurato’, not ‘Figurato Standard’.)

#### Chords

From a semantical point of view the chord tool may seem like the best choice, but it isn’t. You can select Figurato in the chord tool, but you’d have to position all the numbers yourself, and you can’t access any special characters.
