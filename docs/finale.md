### How to use Figurato in Finale

There are two ways to create figured bass indications with Figurato in Finale.

#### Lyrics

1. On the Fonts page of the Document Options dialog set one of the lyric fonts to Figurato.  
2. Switch to the lyrics tool and select the lyric type you just configured for Figurato via the menu.
3. Type the figures directly into your score. Don’t despair if the figures look terrible while you’re typing – Finale’s rendering engine will it out eventually.  
4. You’ll need to remove unwanted extender lines one by one and reposition a few figures manually.  

The process is basically the same as described in [this section of the Finale manual](https://usermanuals.finalemusic.com/FinaleMac/Content/Finale/ht-figured-bass.htm), except that we use Figurato instead of the FinaleNumerics font.


#### Text expressions

If you only need a few standard figures you can also define a new category for text expressions and create a single expression for every figure. (Same here, make sure you set the font to ‘Figurato’, not ‘Figurato Standard’.)

#### Chords

From a semantical point of view the chord tool may seem like the best choice, but it isn’t. You can select Figurato in the chord tool, but you’d have to position all the numbers yourself, and you can’t access any special characters.
