* 0.3
	- The stacking order has been inverted. Figures are now automatically stacked top-down. Figures in documents that were created with a version prior to 0.3 will look different when you install this version.
	- Accidentals can now be placed both to the left and to the right of the numbers in one figure.
	- Support for parentheses has been expanded (still limited).
	- Minor enhancements to the glyph outlines.

* 0.2.1
	- The line height has been reduced. Change the font size in documents that were created with a version prior to 0.2.1 to 50%. I recommend 9pt absolute.
