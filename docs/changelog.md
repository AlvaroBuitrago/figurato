- Latest (0.3.1.11)
	- The outlines of the italic figures have been overhauled.
	- Slashed itacic figures have been added.
	- Accidentals in parentheses do no longer collide with the numbers they modify. Generally improved horizontal positioning of parentheses.
	- The kerning tables for up to three accidentals (natural, flat, sharp) in adjacent layers are now complete. As double flat and double sharp are rarely ever used for figured bass I consider working them into the tables not worth the (considerable) effort.
- 0.3
	- The stacking order has been inverted. Figures are now automatically stacked top-down. **Figures in documents that were created with a version prior to 0.3 will look different when you install the latest version.**
	- Accidentals can now be placed both to the left and to the right of the numbers in one figure.
	- Support for parentheses has been expanded (still limited).
	- Minor enhancements to the glyph outlines.

- 0.2.1
	- The line height has been reduced. Change the font size in documents that were created with a version prior to 0.2.1 to 50%.
